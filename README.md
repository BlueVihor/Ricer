# How to add a rice into this repo?

First, you need to structure your rice correctly. Create a new folder with the name of the rice you want to share. Copy your `.config` directory into the newly created directory. Try to put only files neccesary for achieving the same looks as in the preview in the `.config` folder. Then create an issue at the github Ricer page. Add a preview and upload the folder you just created. Your request will be soon reviewed.
